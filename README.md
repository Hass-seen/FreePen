## Introduction:

  technological advancement has provided to humanity near infinite possibilities.
the realm journalism is arguably one of the  one most benefited by recent technological advancements,
social media opened    endless prospects for media companies and reporters to reach audiences untapped
for them before.
  
 In recent years social media platforms such as twitter became the main source of news consumption
for the majority of the younger generations (millennials and younger).


  it is evident for any new up and coming reporter in is essential for them to have a sizable presence

limited to being short in the case of Twitter, or their reporting gets drowned down by endless causal
content such is the case of Youtube and Facebook.


  Freedom Pen is a social media platform focused on offering up and coming freelance reporters a place 
where they are unhindered by censorship, where their content is presented in a professional setting. 
a place where they can archive their work, expand their portfolio, and establish connections with other
reporters all around the globe.
