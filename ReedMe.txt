In this phase of JavaScript and JQuery, the following has been implemented:


1-	A class called “user” was implemented in Sigin-up.js where every new user that signs
 up fills in the textboxes, then the data is stored in the system as an object of type 
 “user”, these users are stored temporarily in an array, where in the future these objects
  will be stored in the Database.



2-	A class called “post” was implemented in home.js where every new post that is posted
 will be stored as an object of type “post” ,  and these objects are stored in an array 
 called “posts”.


     The posting process, goes as follows:


      in the home page, in the top right corner of the central div, there is an upload 
      symbol in red,if this button is pressed, a div will appear in the middle of the webpage,
      with two text boxes, one for the subject of the post, and the other for the body of the post,
      if one or both of the textboxes  is left empty and the “post” button (in the bottom left of the posting div)
      the user will be prompted to fill both boxes. if   both text boxes are filled and the “post” button is pressed,
      then a new div with the contents of the post will appear in the “feed” which is the central div.



      Make a few posts, with some key words; keep them in mind for further testing the search bar functionality. 

     In the posts present in the central div, each has an “up vote” button, with the count within it, this each 
     post has this button linked to it, and every time you hit the button, the post’s likes which is one of its 
     fields is incremented by one, using the “like()” method present in the class “post”.



    If the “trending” button is pressed (in the right div of the webpage) the posts will be sorted from most liked to least liked



    if the “zoom” button is pressed (a magnifying glass shape, in the top right of the central div) the font size of the posts will increase, if pressed again the font size will go back to normal.



    If the “refresh” button is pressed (a looping arrow shape, in the top right of the central div) all posts will be cleared, but that is only visual, because these posts are still present in the posts array in the system. 



    if the “search” button is pressed(in the right div of the webpage) a textbox will appear, if a word is entered in this textbox and then the ley “enter” is pressed, the central div will be cleared and only posted with this word present in the subject or in the body will show up.




    currently the posting aspect of the website is not at its intended level, the website should give the user the abuilty to post like what has been intreduced above, or upload a pdf where the first page of whice will be convered into a png, and work as an "href" to the pdf itself, unfortunatly due to limitations of the current phase of development that goal was unatainable, for lack of a place to stor uploaded pdfs (aka a database)
